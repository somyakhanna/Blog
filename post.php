                    <p>To the point: Mogliâ€™s at City Centre, Gurugram is the perfect place to get a coffee dose, for kick-starting your day</p>
                    <p>Two guys were sitting idle trying to figure out where to get a cup of nice coffee. An idea came to their caffeine deprived brains-why not make one on their own. This is how they decided to take up a noble cause of selling brilliant coffee, on a price which is cheaper than the popular coffee shops. </p>

                    <p>It is a blessing for those who cannot stay without coffee, but donâ€™t want to spend too much on it. That is why they have a tagline which says â€œIt just tastes expensiveâ€?. What made us fall in love with this place is their, Bhayankar Thandi Coffee. Donâ€™t judge it by the name! But it is indeed as kickass as the name.</p>

                    <p>Whoever said thereâ€™s no better high than a coffee high, probably had this coffee before saying it. Strong brewed coffee, with flavours like Brownie, Choco Chip to name a few. But our favourite is the Bhayankar Cramel Cold Coffee. We bet youâ€™ll get addicted to it. â€œIsko piya toh life jhingalala!â€?</p>
